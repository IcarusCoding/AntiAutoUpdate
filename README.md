</h1>
<h4 align="center">A root based android app that forces decoupling of the PlayStore auto-update system from selected apps.</h4>

## Planned features
* Integrate root access through the usage of the [Shizuku-API](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API])
* More user-friendly app-selection with the ability to sort, filter and search
* Pre-defined profiles
## Known issues
* The current way of disabling the auto-update process involves forcefully putting the app on the app-wishlist, which obviously interferes with your real wishlist
